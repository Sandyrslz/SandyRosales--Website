        <p class="lead mb-4">I am currently a full-time college student. I am the oldest of four children. I was born and raised in San Bernardino,California. I come from a Mexican background and continuously learn things about the way my family lived their lives. My family and I carry on the traditions that my family has been a part of. I am proud to be Mexican and proud to have such an amazing background. All of my life I have been determined to be successful and to do everything I need to in order to succeed.<br><br>

       Throughout my high school years, all I could think about is what college I was going to pick and what I was going to major in. I had originally had my heart set on majoring in Mathematics because that has always been my favorite subject for as long as I can remember. Math has always been my favorite subject because I loved using different methods to solve problems and just loved that I never got tired of it. After I decided to major in Math, I began thinking of the career I wanted to pursue with it. Then I realized that I possibly wanted to become a teacher simply because I have always enjoyed helping classmates when they struggled and I took it as an advantage to help me improve.  <br><br>

        Once I actually began taking my college courses and began to take the math major class requirements, I began to feel like it was not for me. Although I did still enjoyed learning new math and enjoyed the classes, I felt uninterested as I had felt before I began that path. I started talking to different people I knew to see any ideas as to what I wanted to change to. I had talked to so many of my friends and cousins, I still was not sure what I wanted to do. Then one night I began to stress myself out so much with everything and when I say everything, I mean EVERYTHING, not just school related. I basically had a break down. Then my mom began to comfort and talked to me. I told her everything and she listened and gave me so much advice. Then it hit me, how could I miss it when it was right in front of me. I have always looked up to my mom and loved what she did. I saw she even loved her job and had this passion that I never really saw. She is now a Bookkeeper for a Casino, but worked her way up from being a waitress for the casino to working for their accounting to departmetnt to now being the supervisor of her bookkeeping department. She has never once complained about her job because she truly enjoys what she does. I know what you're thinking, "How do you know you'll love the choice in career just because your mom did?". Well, I thought the same thing, so that is why I took a business class that did not need a pre-requisite and realized how much I enjoyed learning in that class and how I found the class so interesting which made me want to continue learning about the working in buisiness.
